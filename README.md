# Lab-2c: Monthly Interest 

## Objectives:

In this lab, you will learn how to do the following:

- Use if, else if, and else statements
- Use the logical "and" operator &&
- Translate categories described in a table to logical code
- Convert imperial measurements to metric


## BMI:

Body Mass Index (BMI) is an indication of a person's health. It is calculated using a personâ€™s height and weight using the following formula: **BMI =kg/m^2**

Here in the United States we still use the Imperial system of measurements and must convert our weight measured in pounds into kilograms and our height measured in inches into meters. This is easily done using the following formulas:

    kg = 0. 45359237 * pounds
    m = 0.0254 * inches

Table showing the interpretation of the BMI number:

## Program: Computing Body Mass Index:

Write a program which will ask the user to enter a monthly savings amount of their choice and an annual interest rate. Have the program calculate and output the account balance after 6 months.

## Key program requirements:

- Use if, else if, and else statements
- Use the logical "and" operator &&
- Nested if statements are NOT allowed in this lab

## Example Run:

_In this program we will calculate a person's BMI._

_Please enter a person's height in inches:_
_70_
_Please enter a person's wheight in pounds:_
_146_
_The person's BMI is: 20.948603801493316. The person has a BMI classification of: Normal_
